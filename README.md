# Matryoshka-style Grid-based Inventory and FPS Controller
 Matryoshka-style Grid-based Inventory System built using C# in Unity.
 This project also includes a basic FPS controller utilizing IK and a procedural recoil system for animation.

## Features:

A **matryoshka-style** system allows an inventory to be stacked inside of another inventory. 
(ex. a backpack inside of a backpack inside of a backpack)

A **grid-based** system allows different sized items to take up multiple slots.
(ex. Diablo, Escape From Tarkov, System Shock 2)

Items labeled as weapons can be **equipped** using the **primary** or **secondary slot**.

A **context menu** provides the user a quicker alternative for doing certain actions such as quickly moving the item to an equip slot with **Equip** or dropping the item with **Drop**.

A **procedural recoil system** determines patterns for the weapon firing animations.
