# Matryoshka-style Grid-based Inventory and FPS Controller
by Sim

I built this Matryoshka-style Grid-based Inventory System using C# in Unity. It also includes a basic FPS controller with IK and a procedural recoil system for animation.

## Features 🧩
- A **matryoshka-style** system allows an inventory to be stacked inside of another inventory. 🎒

(ex. a backpack inside of a backpack inside of a backpack) 


- A **grid-based** system allows different sized items to take up multiple slots. 📦

(ex. Diablo, Escape From Tarkov, System Shock 2) 


- Items labeled as weapons can be **equipped** using the **primary** or **secondary slot**. 🗡️


- A **context menu** provides the user with quick actions such as quickly moving an item to an equip slot with `Equip` or dropping it with `Drop`. 📑


- A **procedural recoil system** determines patterns for the weapon firing animations. 🔫
